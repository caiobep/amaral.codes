          For the last {yearsAsSoftwareEngineer} years, I have been using software
          to leverage people's productivity and creativity by analyzing and assessing
          opportunities. As a kid, I was always fascinated by how UIs and software
          could teach you how to do things without any prior knowledge. Ever since,
          I've decided to dedicate my career to
          <b> Human Computer Interaction</b>
          helping better integrate computers and humans, and hopefully sparking
          the same feeling I've got in newer generations. On my way I've also developed
          a passion for <b>Design</b>, <b>Productivity</b>, <b>History</b>
          and <a href="/posts"> many other topics</a>

          <br />
          <br />

          I believe that good software it's good for <b>everyone</b> so
          focus on building <b>high-quality delightful</b> to use <b>accessible</b> applications that cohesively
          integrate
          with the user's workflow.
