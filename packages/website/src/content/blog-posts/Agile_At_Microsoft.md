# How things used to work

- Long Schedule
- Start knowing what to build
- Coding phase
- Testing and Stabilizing phase
- Shipping 2 times/year
- Product Owner got customer feedback

**This used to work very well!**


In a era where software delivery was very different from what it is today


# What changed?

- Culture
- Approach to teams
- How to plan and learn
- How to stay healthy

# Culture


> üí° _‚ÄúCulture eats strategy for breakfast‚Äù_


Daniel H. Pink Drive (A book of motivation)


We can motivate people with

- Rewards
- Punishment

Does work. Although you‚Äòll get better results if you can give people

- Autonomy
- Mastery
- Purpose

Example:


### Group A

- Business Plan
- Established in the market
- Well funded
- Hiring the best people

### Group B

- Working for free
- In their spare time
- Because they want to

Group A vs Group B ? Where would you put your money?


Group B > Group A

## Aligned Autonomy


Alignment vs Autonomy

- Too much alignment wil l make people hate their jobs
- Too much autonomy will make people have different decisions for their selfs

**The key is to have a balance**


# People


Stop thinking about individuals and start thinking about teams. **Agile is a team sport**


### Program Management

- What we‚Äôre building
- Why we‚Äôre building

### Engineers

- How we‚Äôre building
- Quality of what we‚Äôre building

### Teams at Microsoft

- Cross discipline
- 10-12 people
- Self managing
- Clear charter and goals
- Intact for 12-18 months
- Physical team rooms
- Own features in production
- Own deployment of features

### Old Teams

- UI
- API
- Database

**Tons of dependency management**


Try to make everyone that owns all responsibility in the software, in order to share the kanban board. Nominate specialists from each team to review code.


## Yellow Sticky Exercise


**Autonomy:** Allow anyone choose what they want to work on.


**Alignment:** Ensure we‚Äôve got the right balance across teams.


## Sprint Mails


Every team sends a email in the end of a sprint telling everyone

- What they accomplished
- Share a v√≠deo showing what they did
- Tell everyone what‚Äôs next

# How we plan and Learn


Continuous  planning.


The value of planning is not the actual results, but the act of plan itself.


### Planning Steps

- Sprint (3 weeks)
- Plan (3 sprints)
- Season (6 months)
- Strategy (12 months)

Strategy and features are part of the **alignment**


Features, tasks and etc are part of **Autonomy**


**Always plan 3 sprints ahead**


**Continually Plan**


**Continually Learn**


# Stay Healthy


‚ÄúJust because we‚Äôre not sick, doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre healthy‚Äù


A lot of bugs


### Bug Cap


Number of engineers *. 5 = X


10 * 5 = 50


If your bug count exceeds your bug cap, stop working on new features


### L-Team


Deals with all live-site issues and interruptions 


Shields the team for interruptions 


### F-Team


Work on committed features (new work)


Rotate the responsibility.
