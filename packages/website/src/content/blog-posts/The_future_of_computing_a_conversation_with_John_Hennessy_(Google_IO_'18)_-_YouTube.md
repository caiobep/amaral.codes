# Future of Computing


First of all I would like to take a moment just to talk about John Leroy Hennessy, who is an American computer scientist, academician, businessman and Chair of Alphabet Inc. Hennesy is one of the founders of MIPS Computer Systems Inc. as well as Atheros and served as tenth President of Stanford University. Hennessy announced that he would step down in summer of 2016


Hennessy talks about the future of computing and the challenges we face today, he compares Python Code To C and to C using processor's Domain Specific Languages, becoming clear that we need to advance in software in order to have a better use of our hardware. Mainly for machine learning and artificial intelligence. He presents some examples of frameworks that takes advantages of DSL's like tensorflow. 


Hennessy shows us that Moore's law is coming to it's end.
