As you might know, macOS is a great operational system, although it has some great features, it is certainly not the best at _**Windows**_ management. I wonder why ü§î.


The good thing is that macOS is a very open platform and developers are able to contribute to the OS on core level features, such as window management.


Here are my top favorite window managers for macOS:


## Amethyst


Amethyst is a great [tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) for macOS, probably the closest thing to [i3](https://i3wm.org/) you can have after [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) (which requires you to disable [_SIP_](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899)_)_

## Rectangle


I used to be an avid user of [Spectacle](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle#important-note) however, ever since the project has been discontinued I started to use Rectangle instead. It is an Ok app, theres nothing super magical about it.
