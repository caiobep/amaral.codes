# Studying


Study is the best thing we can do! It empower us with knowledge, and shows us different ways to think and act.


## Information as a Flow


As [Tiago Forte](https://www.notion.so/a9cfeb3673cb4cd5955b501db40be561) say, we‚Äôre constantly studying and discovering new information. Our monkey brains is not ready to understand and process the information in the speed of the modern days. We consume a lot of information making it hard for our brains to understand and process the information.


[Alura](https://www.notion.so/194ddc1adab9457481de2f3499b590e4)  courses say pretty much the same. To understand and use some new knowledge we need time for our brains to compute, and really understand.


## Learn How You Learn


[Felipe Deschamps](https://www.notion.so/c4a70cd8bf3e496ba2478c3670e6a2bf) reported on a video collaboration with Guilherme Pato, that learning how he learn was a very important step on getting better at learning. Right now [Felipe Deschamps](https://www.notion.so/c4a70cd8bf3e496ba2478c3670e6a2bf) uses a technique similar to Flash Cards but with more practices in a wider space of time.


This technique takes advantage of the brain plasticity.
