# Study


Studing is **Hard.** Learning new things is awesome, but conditioning our brains to form new patterns and understand things in a new way, cannot be too easy, otherwise we wouldn't have formed opinions, because we we're going to form new ones every time. The contrary is also very bad, if we stick to only one point of view, it could get very hard to evolve and learn new things. 


So we have the perfect balance between remembering and forgetting, this way we can form new patterns and adapt ourselfs to our needs. 



If we want our brains to remember things fast, and efficient, we need to constantly revisit some information. [Tiago Forte](https://www.notion.so/a9cfeb3673cb4cd5955b501db40be561) brilhantly suggest us to revisit and reinteract with our information in different ways, either by making resumes, diagrams, drawings, anything that makes the information shakes in our brains, in order to keep it alive.


Another strategy is to use Flashcars like the ones provided by apps like Studies and Anki.
