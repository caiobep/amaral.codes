## The Rise and Fall of [Motivation 2.0](https://www.notion.so/82c0fc2b6cf045d6abb25ad5b909b32b) 


Much like computers, people and society have their own operating system. A set of rules and habits where they lay the foundation off their actions on.


A long time ago, society used to run on what is called _**Motivation 1.0**__,_ an operational system where hunger and sex is the most important thing therefore the main drive of all our actions. 


> 🍖 **Motivation 1.0** **is all about Survival**


> 🥕 **Motivation 2.0** **External Rewards and Punishments**


> 🧠 **Motivation 3.0** **Intrinsic Motivation**


Some time after that we started running the [Motivation 2.0](https://www.notion.so/82c0fc2b6cf045d6abb25ad5b909b32b)  system, where _rewards_ and _punishments_ are the main drive for most of our actions. That worked fine for routine 20th century tasks. But in the 21st century [Motivation 2.0](https://www.notion.so/82c0fc2b6cf045d6abb25ad5b909b32b)  have shown to be incompatible with how we organized what we do, how we think about what we do and how we do what we do. It's time for [Motivation 3.0](https://www.notion.so/139e744075894ebab14ab61147506603)
