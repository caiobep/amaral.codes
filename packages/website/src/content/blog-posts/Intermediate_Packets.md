# Intermediate Packets


[Intermediate Packets](https://www.notion.so/17e9bde861044c97b537bb2158fe500d) refers to parts of your work. Basically how you divide your work in terms of projects. This will help you finish a single task of a project when you have some time left.



Ex: whenever you get a 40 minute window, you probably cannot finish a whole project, but you can finish a task, a intermediate packet from a project.
