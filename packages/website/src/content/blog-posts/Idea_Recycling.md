# Idea Recycling


Pretty similar to [Borrowed Creativity](https://www.notion.so/5bd2f335c69a4a4697660c39932123a6), but to your own self. Recycle ideas that you previously had. Imagine that your future self and past self are strangers, write your notes for your future self.


Refine those ideas multiple times, visit your notes and think about them again.
