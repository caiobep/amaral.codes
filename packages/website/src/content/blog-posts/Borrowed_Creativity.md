# Borrowed Creativity 


Borrowing creativity means gatthering existing ideas to create something new. 


It is way to risky to try to start from scrach, to create something from zero, use what already exisits to help you create somethign new. This way you'll increase your success chances, because you're already filtering errors that other people already went through.


This is kind of contaditory for most people because we're taught from school not to copy other people jobs, but in fact by copying and adding your're being productive, you're borrowing others thinking, so creating a collective thought, a colletive conscience
