# Apple Computers


Steve Jobs quits Apple and founds [**NeXT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT)


Hire **Objective-C** Programmers which did not like **C++**


Steve Jobs went back to Apple with [NeXT's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT) **Objective-C** Team


## New Languages

- Type Safe?
- Features?

## Sofware industry


Where are the woman?


# The Future of Programming


# 1936 - Alan Turing


The first person to write code as we recognize as code.


Alan, writes a paper 


[Charles_Petzold-Annotated_Turing-Wiley%282008%29.pdf](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ca8fcc0b-716d-4265-ae24-06110637fc62/Charles_Petzold-Annotated_Turing-Wiley%282008%29.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20231008%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20231008T181728Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=723ec0a98a35f498e380aeb57c1f223f5fb7ff5ff03d7f9c8360038947f61536&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)

- Binary (Reversed ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø )
- Integer `add` and logical `not`
- Invents subroutine
- Invents and codes stack (burry and un-burry instead of push and pop)
- Invents floating point numbers
- etc...

_"We shall need a great number of mathematicians of ability" because "there will probably be a good deal of work of this kind to be done."_


                                                                                                                - Alan Turing


_"One of our difficulties will be the maintenance of an appropriate discipline, so we do not lose track of what we are doing"_
                                                                                                                  - Alan Turing


## 1946


Number of Computers O(1)


Number of Programmers O(1)


## 1950


Core Memory

	- Dencer memory
	- Magnetize both directions
	- Larger Memories

Tubes

	- Radios
	- Televisions
	- Computers (possible to build with tubes)

## 1953


Fotran Creation

- No Indentation
- GOTO's
- No Types
- Hand Written
- Cards
- Care-full with I's O's and 7's
- Programmers Were not allowed to touch computers
- Computer Operators do not like programmers (because programmers want to try programs)
- The program output will come on the other day.
- To deal with that every programmer had 7 parallel program.

## 1958

- Functional Programming
- LISP

## 1960


IBM sold 140 model 70x computers running fortran


O(1E2) Computers in the world


O(1E3) Programmers in the world

- No Libraries
- No help

## 1960 Programmers

- Programmers were not trained on schools
- Engineers
- Scientists
- Mathematicians
- 30's 40's 50's
- Understood projects
- Understood management
- Were trusted by business

## 1965


Very expensive machine rents from IBM


O(1E4) Computers in the world


O(1E5) Programmers in the world


Less than 20 years since Turing wrote his code


Where does all this people come from?


Not enough people

- Engineers, Scientists, Mathematicians
- No CS Grads
- Programmers drawn from:
- Best and brightest
	- Accountants, Planners
- Understood management
- Understood business
- Not mathematicians
- Disciplined...

## 1966


IBM's renting computers


Simula-67 - First Object Oriented Language


Object Orientation


## 1968


Dijkstra wrote a article to avoid GOTO;


Disciplined Mathematicians ‚Üí C and Linux/Unix


## 1970


O(1E5) ‚Üí Computers in the world


O(1E6) ‚Üí Computers in the world


25 years


	## Programmers Were Young


	Lack of discipline, but with a lot of energy, crazy hours, hyper-focus and cheap


	**Young boys need discipline**


	**‚Üí The Waterfall Model**


	The average age of programmers went down by 20 years. Programmers are now in ther 20's 


	The number of programmers double every five years


	We do not have enough teachers to teach everyone! That's why the area have so many mistakes.


	## Before 80's 


	Programming Field

		- Old People
		- Programmers were disciplined professionals
		- They didn't need a lot of management or process
		- They knew how to manage their time, communicate, and work together
		- They understood deadlines and commitments, **What to leave in  and what to leave out**

	Accomplishments

		- IBM 360 Virtual Memory OS
		- NASA: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo
		- Structured, Functional, Object-Oriented
		- Fortran, Cobol, Agol, Lisp, C, Unix

	## Agile


	Is the process used


# Today


What have changed?


	 Sofware! _The iPhone represents the World economy_


	## What's Changing

	- Multicore
	- Massive Parallelism
	- Quantum Computers

	## What Must Change

	- Sofware Professionalism

## 1995

- Original cohort of disciplined professionals retires.
- First wave of career programmers comes of age (well over 40)
- We foresee the need to change

## 1995 - The Waterfall Era Change

- **Scrum**: Schwaber, Beedle, DeVos, et. al.
- **XP**: Beck, Cunningham
- **FDD**: Coad.
- **Crystal**: Cockburn

## 2001 - Snowbird Agile Manifesto


![](./images/d8606ce0-bcb3-4271-94e8-cbc362ab5dd4.webp)


## Agile Manifesto


**Individuals and interactions** over process and tools.


**Working Software** over comprehensive document.


**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.


**Responding to change** over following a plan.


## Agile Requires Discipline

- Working in fixed time boxes.
- Estimating in relative units.
- Customer Communication
- Continuous Integration
- Collaboration
- Much more...

	## Extreme Programming (XP)

	- The most technical disciplines
	- TDD
	- Refactoring
	- Simple Design
	- Acceptance Tests
	- Metaphor

	Many of us tough that these technical disciplines were the glue that made the whole agile process work properly. Without those technical - dare I say _Mathematical disciplines,_ the code being produced would grow and evolve in ways that made it harder and harder to work with.


	Lose track of what we are doing.


	**Turing:** Discipline and Ability


	**Agile:** Discipline


	**Agile:** Craftsmanship


	**Agile:** Professionalism


	## Business Loves and Understand


	Business ‚ô•Ô∏è Discipline


	Business ‚ô•Ô∏è SCRUM


	Business ‚ô•Ô∏è Certification


	## Business Do not Understand


	So they won't assume any risk.


	Business üö´ Programmers


	Business üö´ Tests


	Business üö´ Pair Programming


	Business üö´ Refactoring


	Business üö´ Simple Design


	## Flaccid Scrum


	Scrum without value


	Scrum without deliver


	Scrum without technical practice


	Scrum without order


# The Invasion of Project Managers


> Caused by certifications, which attracted the wrong people, **PM's**


So the agile movement ‚Üí project managers ‚Üí craftsmanship technical practices


**Agile were made by programmers,**


**Agile** is not about Kanban, LEAN or any of that.


**Agile** is not about business people.


**Agile** is not about project managers people.


## Irony


Kent Back at Snowbird stated a goal for Agile:


Healing of the divide between business and programming


**Agile was about bringing business and programmers closer together**


**FAILED**


## What Must Change?

- Agile must Grow Up.
- Define our profession
- Choose our practices and disciplines
- Reunify Agile/Craftsmanship
- ...And Lead!

## Problem


The world depends on programmers


In ways they do not understand


In ways we do not understand


## Your Grandmother 


> Interactions with a software system

- Buy things
- Sell something
- Get insurance
- Telephone Calls
- Car (over 10K lines of code)
- Microwave
- Wash your clothes

## Software Engineers Are Killing People


The world depends on us, they do not understand, we do not understand.


# WE RULE THE WORLD


## Someday a software disaster will happen!


That day, politics will point their fingers will look at us and ask why that happen!


~~My boss made my do that~~


~~We had a deadline~~


## Regulations

- What books we have to read
- What languages we have to use
- What platforms we can use
- What processors we have to use
- What process we have to follow

We'll be regulated


Cause we're dangerous


We kill people. 


## Regulate Ourselves Before!

- Take a oath(doctors, layers)
- Create a body that violate programmers
