# Projects over Categories


This is a little bit controversial. Tiago talks about a way to organize your notes but later on the show, tell us about a use case where he used another way, but anyway. Projects over category implies the idea that you're actually keeping yourself accountable, and having notes just like handbooks along the way. On the other hand categories exists for indexation purposes only. The problem with categories is that they are endless. Is the same problem we have with tags.


Now don't get me wrong, tags are amazing! But organizing your notes into projects keeps you more productive since you don't have to index all your tasks everytime you enter them, and also makes it a little bit easier to find.
