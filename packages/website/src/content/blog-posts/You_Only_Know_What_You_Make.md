# [You Only Know What You Make](https://www.notion.so/7d4dc00060404048920cde48c3732df6) 


Similar to a repo I've saw on my early GitHub days, You Only Know what you build. You need to build something in order to check if you actually understand. Consuming something without actually checking your knowledge, is a waste of time. You have to produce something. 


Kudos if you can share what you're producing.
