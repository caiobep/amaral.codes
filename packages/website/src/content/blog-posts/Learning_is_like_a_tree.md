## Learning is Like a Tree


As Elon Musk once said, learning is like a concept tree. We learn the basis and then we start to get into each particular thing about something. 


Each time we try to make our knowledge perfect at some area we approach to the leaf, and leafs fall very fast.


So in order to learn something, try to understand the basic concepts and try not to get stuck at some small thing just to impress yourself of someone. 


## Deliver Projects


Try to deliver something after you learned something new. This will help you on check our own understanding of something, and actually maintain you productive, creating a _**Positive Event Loop**_ on your brain
