# Memory


The bedrock of all data structures, memory is the underlying concept that you absolutely need to know in order to understand why data structures work the way they do.

## Memory

<details>
<summary>Bounded Memory Slots</summary>

The important thing is to Know that memory are bounded, they have a limit.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Stored in Base 2 (Binary)</summary>

Values are stored in Binary


</details>

<details>
<summary>1 Memory slot Can Hold 8bits or 1 Byte</summary>

Integers will always have fixed width (that's what allows us to increment and decrement without having any issues)

Lists will always fill the space of it's members

A memory slot can indicate another memory slot

## Memory


Broadly speaking, memory is the foundational layer of computing where all data is stored.


In the context of coding interviews, it's important node the following points:

- Data stored in memory is stored in bytes and, by extension bits.
- Bytes in memory can "point" to other bytes in memory, so as to store references to other data.
- The amount of memory that a machine has is bounded, making it valuable to limit how memory an algorithm takes up.
- Accessing a byte of a fixed number of bytes (like 4 bytes or 8 bytes in the case of 32-bit and 64-bit integers) is an elementary operation, which can be loosely treated as a single unit of operational work
